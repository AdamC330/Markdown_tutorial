# Markdown_cheatsheet
This is a repo that contains the content for a jekyll template (docksy). I put text files here to store them in case of exporting the files to a new jekyll template.

## What is Markdown?


Markdown is a markup language that consists of text-encoded symbols...

Inline Code Block:

To create an inline code blockcode, you have to use a backtick ` at the beginning of the code and at the end of it.

`<p> This is a paragraph </p>`

---

Code Blocks:

If you want to write a code block, you have to enclose the code with three backticks \` at the beginning of the code and at the end of it.

\```
your code here \``\`
```
npm install
npm start
```
---

Or you can specify a programming language in which the code is written after typing the initial three backtiscks i.e. 

"```javascript
function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}```"

"```python
def add(num1, num2):
  return num1 + num2
}```"


```javascript
function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
```

```python
def add(num1, num2):
  return num1 + num2
}

```
